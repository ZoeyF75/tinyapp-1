# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The short urls will fingerprint and track views. The raw data is accessible to the user on the details page for the url. Users are also able to edit the short urls to something memorable(/netflix instead of /s8fkj7).
